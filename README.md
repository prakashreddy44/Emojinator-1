# EMOJIANTOR 

This program converts your facial expression into corresponding facial emoji. The model is trained on 450 images of customized faces for each emoji.Right now it supports the following 5 emojis :- <br>
<h2>
1 - ðŸ™‚ <br>
2 - ðŸ¤« <br>
3 - ðŸ˜‰ <br>
4 - ðŸ˜€ <br>
5 - ðŸ˜‘ <br></h2>

<h4><i>NOTE: The model is trained on the dataset on my face. So it is suggested to recreate dataset by running face_recorder.py.</i></h4><br>

<h2> Installations/Requirements</h2>

1-Keras </br>
2-OpenCV </br>
3-Pickle </br>
4-Dlib </br>
5-imutils </br> 
6-shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat

<h2> Steps </h2.

1- Firstly run face_recorder.py. This will save the customized faces for each emoji into their corresponding labelled folder. Total number of required training images for an emoji is 450 so while executing face_recorder.py the emoji number will automatically itterate on completion of clicking of 450 images.<br>
2- Then run dataset_creator.py to create train and test image dataset.<br>
3- Then run training_model.py to create prediction model.<br>
4- Finally run run.py to convert your real time facial expresiion into emoji.<br>
5- There is also a file named mask.py which contains the algorithm to mask out required landmarks from the face.
